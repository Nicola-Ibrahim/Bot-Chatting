  # Frontend service
  #
  # This service runs the Next.js based UI that demonstrates how to consume the
  # API exposed by the FastAPI backend.  During development the container
  # runs `npm run dev` to enable hot‑reloading.  The `BACKEND_URL`
  # environment variable tells the frontend where to find the API on the docker
  # network.  The port 3000 on the host exposes the development server.
