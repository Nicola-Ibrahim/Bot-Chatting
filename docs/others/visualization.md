# 🎨 Architecture Visualization References

We use a combination of standard models and modern tooling to document our system architecture.

---

## 🏗️ Modeling Standards

- **[C4 Model](https://c4model.com)**: The primary model used for our System Context (C1) and Container (C2) diagrams. It provides a hierarchical way to think about system structure.
- **[DDD Modeling](https://github.com/ddd-crew/free-ddd-learning-resources)**: Resources for Bounded Context Mapping and Event Storming.

---

## 🛠️ Recommended Tooling

- **[Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/)**: Used for in-repository diagrams (sequence, flow, class) that render directly in GitHub and most IDEs.
- **[Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)**: A great tool for prototyping diagrams before adding them to the markdown.
- **[Structurizr](https://structurizr.com)**: Power-user tooling for C4 diagrams and architecture-as-code.
- **[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)**: For quick, hand-drawn style sketches during design sessions.

> [!TIP]
> When adding new diagrams to the documentation, prefer **Mermaid** whenever possible to keep the diagrams version-controlled alongside the code.
