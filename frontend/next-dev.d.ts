/**
 * This file ensures TypeScript picks up Next.js types when working within
 * a monorepo or custom project structure. It is analogous to the
 * automatically generated `next-env.d.ts` that ships with create-next-app.
 *
 * Do not remove or modify this file; doing so can cause type-checking
 * issues and will be overwritten by any future Next.js upgrades.

// NOTE: Additional type definitions can be added here if necessary.
