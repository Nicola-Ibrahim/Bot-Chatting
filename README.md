# ü§ñ **Bot Chat System**

## üöÄ **Overview**

This repository contains a **Bot Chat System** built with **FastAPI** and adhering to **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles. The system is modular, scalable, and maintainable, integrating essential features such as **authentication**, **user management**, and **bot conversations**.

The architecture is designed using **Clean Architecture** and **Modularization of a Monolithic Application**, ensuring that each feature operates within its own **bounded context**. This separation of concerns helps in managing complexity and promoting long-term maintainability.

### üåü **Key Features**

- **FastAPI**: High-performance web framework for building APIs, offering asynchronous support and automatic API documentation via Swagger.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The system follows DDD principles to maintain clear boundaries and isolate business logic in dedicated modules.
- **Command Query Separation (CQS)**: Implements CQS to separate read and write operations, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login using JWT tokens with role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Bot Conversations**: The bot interacts with users, processes input, and manages conversation states.
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications are sent about key events, such as message updates or system alerts, ensuring users stay informed.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Utilizes domain events to handle business logic changes and ensure consistency across the system.
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses dependency injection to manage dependencies and promote loose coupling between components.

## üîç **System Overview**

This bot system is designed with modularity in mind, following best practices to ensure the system is both scalable and maintainable. The implementation leverages **Clean Architecture** principles and **Modularization of the Monolith** to provide a clear separation of concerns between different modules.

Key components include:

- **Core Layer**: Houses the main domain logic, including business rules, entities, and value objects.
- **Application Layer**: Contains use cases that orchestrate interactions between domain services and external interfaces like APIs.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Manages communication with external resources, such as databases, message queues, and external APIs.
- **Presentation Layer**: Exposes the FastAPI API for external consumers, providing endpoints for interaction with the system.

Each feature (e.g., **auth**, **chat**, **notifications**) is encapsulated within its own bounded context, making the system easy to extend and maintain.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Core Layer: Domain Logic**

The **Core Layer** is the heart of the system, responsible for the main business logic and domain models. In this layer, we define:

- **Entities**: Business objects that have a distinct identity (e.g., `User`, `Participants`).
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects that represent concepts in the domain (e.g., `Content`, `Feedback`).
- **Aggregates**: Collections of entities and value objects treated as a unit (e.g., `Conversation`. `Message`).
- **Domain Services**: Provide business logic that doesn't naturally belong to an entity (e.g., `UserService`, `MessageService`).

This layered architecture ensures clear boundaries between business logic, infrastructure concerns, and application-specific code.

## üìÑ **Running the Application**

For more details on setting up and running the application, please refer to the [Running the Application guide](./BUILDING.md).

### üßë‚Äçüíª **Authentication & Authorization**

The system uses **JWT** for secure user authentication. Upon successful login, a token is issued, which must be provided in subsequent requests to validate user actions.

#### **Endpoints**

- **POST /auth/login**: User login endpoint to authenticate and return a JWT token.

  - **Request Body:**

    ```json
    {
      "username": "string",
      "password": "string"
    }
    ```

  - **Response:**

    ```json
    {
      "access_token": "jwt_token",
      "token_type": "bearer"
    }
    ```

- **POST /auth/refresh**: Refresh JWT token.

  - **Request Body:**

    ```json
    {
      "refresh_token": "string"
    }
    ```

  - **Response:**

    ```json
    {
      "access_token": "new_jwt_token"
    }
    ```

## üí¨ **Bot Conversations**

The **Conversation** entity manages the bot interactions with users, maintaining the conversation flow and ensuring state consistency.

#### **Endpoints**

- **GET /conversations/{conversation_id}**: Fetch a specific conversation by its ID.

  - **Response:**

    ```json
    {
      "conversation_id": "string",
      "messages": [
        {
          "sender": "bot",
          "content": "Hello, how can I assist you?"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

- **POST /conversations/{conversation_id}/messages**: Send a message to the conversation.

  - **Request Body:**

    ```json
    {
      "sender": "user",
      "content": "I need help with my order"
    }
    ```

  - **Response:**

    ```json
    {
      "message_id": "string",
      "status": "sent"
    }
    ```

## üîß **Conclusion**

By following **Domain-Driven Design** and utilizing **FastAPI**, this bot system is highly modular and easily extendable. With clear boundaries between different concerns (such as authentication, notifications, and conversations), it‚Äôs easy for new developers to contribute and expand the system. The detailed documentation and organized file structure will guide you through the system, making it simple to understand and interact with the project.
